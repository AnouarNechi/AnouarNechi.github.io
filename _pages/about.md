I am a Research Assistant at the University of L端beck, Germany, where I am actively pursuing my Ph.D. My research focuses on utilizing field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Prior to this, I established a strong foundation in computer science through my studies at the Higher Institute of Computer Science in Tunis, where I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in embedded systems and industrial computer science, respectively. I further broadened my knowledge by completing an M.Sc. in Information System Techniques at the National Engineering School of Tunis.

I am passionate about the potential of FPGA-based AI acceleration to revolutionize various industries and am committed to contributing to this exciting field through my research.
